          <p><em> For the past 3 years, I’ve been studying as an engineering student at Graphic era university. <br>
          What really got me into the field of computer science is my love for machines and logic. <br>
          Throughout my school life, I’ve noticed that I’ve always been good with numbers, handling data, operating machines and making software’s.
          Apart from my love for technology, I am a <br> good orator. I have won many debate competitions. <br> Besides being a orator I am also a content writer.
          Currently I am doing the job for NSS GEU. <br> I have also done an internship as a content writer in a startup.
          Moving forward, I hope to expand my experience across different sun fields related to computers and engineering. Particularly fine <br> learning, which is why I’m here I'm an engineering student..</em></p>

            <ul>
              <li>Under this project I trained a basic CNN model on MNIST hand-written dataset to predict hand written digits . Model was trained till 10 epochs up to the accuracy of 98.3% .</li>
              <li>Model consists of a convolution layer, maxpooling, dense, flattening and dropout layers. Tensorflow was used to build and save the model .</li>
              <li>Matplotlib is used to visualize the image and to plot loss and accuracy to get an insight into it.</li>

          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>A recommender system, similar image finder has to be implemented in this project. Flipkart image dataset from Kaggle having around 18322 images of different products is used.</li>
              <li>To find similar images, I have made use of Euclidean distance and have output the top 3 images. Until now, I have pre-trained resnet-50 network to extract image feature and use them to find similar images.</li>
              <li>Furthermore, I will be using auto-encoder instead of resnet-50 to achieve the ultimate goal of the project.</li>
